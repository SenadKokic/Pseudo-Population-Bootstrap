This repository contains an R implementation of the pseudo-population bootstrap sampling method proposed by Chen et. al (2019). 

The implementation of the first 3 steps of the algorithm is contained in the .ipynb file. 

The remaining files are PDFs of SAS code (and results) used to compare the variance estimates generated by VARMETHOD = BOOTSTRAP, and VARMETHOD = TAYLOR, 
along with the data used for comparison (being an edition of the Survey of Youth in Custody).
